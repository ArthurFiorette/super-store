### Notes:

As the Stream Elements api sucks in many ways, most of this was hardcoded by me. The only
oficial documentation lacks a lot, so most of the code, especially the types folder, are a
combination of guesses and looking at the json responses from them.

If you are trying to understand what are going here, you probably need some extras
documentation. I got some help from users that already used SE Api in the past and from
the official Stream Elements Devs discord server.

Some links that might help:

- [Stream Elements Documentation](https://dev.streamelements.com/)
- [Websocket example with Socket.io 2.2.0](https://dev.streamelements.com/docs/kappa/docs/Websockets.md)
- [Github with examples for widgets](https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets/blob/master/CustomCode.md)
- [Stream Elements Devs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/x5SUNGHhrP)

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, but i don't know if i'll be able to answer
them. ðŸ‘‹
